                    <div class="subtitle">6. Third-Party Transactions, Charges and Release</div>
                    <p>Third Party Services providers (including Distributing Retailers) referenced through the Platform are independent contractors and not agents or employees of Echoed. Echoed is not liable for the acts, errors, omissions, representations, warranties, breaches or negligence of any such Third Party Services providers or from any personal injuries, death, property damage, or other damages or expenses resulting therefrom.  Your relationship with Third Party Services providers is governed by separate terms and conditions as established by each Third Party Services provider, and when you use, purchase, or receive any Third Party Services, your relationship is directly with the third party. It is your responsibility to understand and abide by all payment obligations, privacy policies, and other terms and conditions that apply to any Third Party Services you elect to use, purchase, or receive. You agree that we will have no liability for any claims, losses or damages arising out of or in connection with your use of any Third Party Services, even if we have referred you to the particular third party, and you will indemnify us and hold us harmless against any claims arising out of or relating to your use, purchase, or receipt of Third Party Services, your acts or omissions, or your breach of any terms or conditions applicable thereto.</p>

                    <p>WHILE ECHOED FACILITATES REWARDS PROGRAMS (AS DEFINED BELOW), THE DISTRIBUTING RETAILER, AND NOT ECHOED, IS SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL PAYMENTS, CREDITS, OR OTHER REWARDS PROVIDED TO YOU IN CONNECTION WITH YOUR PARTICIPATION IN A REWARDS PROGRAM.  AS A RESULT, IF YOU (A) HAVE ANY DISPUTE RELATED TO THE PROVISION OF OR FAILURE TO PROVIDE ANY PAYMENTS, CREDITS, OR OTHER REWARDS IN CONNECTION WITH A REWARDS PROGRAM, OR (B) HAVE A DISPUTE WITH A THIRD-PARTY SERVICES PROVIDER, YOU RELEASE US (AND OUR OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, AGENTS, SUBSIDIARIES, JOINT VENTURES AND EMPLOYEES) FROM CLAIMS, DEMANDS AND DAMAGES (ACTUAL AND CONSEQUENTIAL) OF EVERY KIND AND NATURE, KNOWN AND UNKNOWN, ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH SUCH DISPUTES. IF YOU ARE A CALIFORNIA RESIDENT, YOU WAIVE CALIFORNIA CIVIL CODE §1542, WHICH SAYS: "A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS WHICH THE CREDITOR DOES NOT KNOW OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE, WHICH IF KNOWN BY HIM MUST HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR."</p>
                    <div class="subtitle">7. Billing and Payment</div>
