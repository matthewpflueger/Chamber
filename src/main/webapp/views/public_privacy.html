                            <p>The Echoed website located at www.echoed.com, as it may be updated, relocated, or otherwise modified from time to time, including any and all information, text, images, and other materials and content appearing on or incorporated into that website (the "<strong>Site</strong>") is operated by Echoed Inc.  Thank you for visiting the Site or otherwise accessing any of our other web sites, networks, embeddable widgets, downloadable software, mobile applications, including tablet computer applications, features, or services, whether on-line or off-line, owned or operated by us (the "<strong>Platform</strong>").</p><br/>
                            <p>Echoed has prepared this privacy policy ("<strong>Privacy Policy</strong>") to describe our information gathering and dissemination practices and our data protection practices for the Platform. The terms "<strong>Echoed</strong>," "<strong>we</strong>," "<strong>us</strong>," and "<strong>our</strong>" refer to Echoed Inc. and its affiliates. The terms "<strong>you</strong>," "<strong>your</strong>," and "<strong>yours</strong>" refer to the user (end user) utilizing the Platform. This Privacy Policy is incorporated into and subject to our Terms of Service located at https://www.echoed.com/tos (the "<strong>TOS</strong>"), and capitalized terms used but not defined in this Privacy Policy are defined in the TOS.</p>
                            <div class="subtitle">Collection of Information</div>
                            <p>Here's what we collect from you when you use the Platform:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>User-Provided Information: When you sign up or register to use the Platform on our Site or through a third-party merchant ("<strong>Distributing Retailer</strong>"), we may ask you to provide certain information, such as your such as first name, last name, email, zip code, age, address, gender, etc., including information that is considered "personally identifiable information" (that is, information that would allow us to directly identify you, such as your name and e-mail address).  We may collect this information at other times as well, such as when you send us an email, when you update the information you've previously provided to us, and at other times when accessing the Platform.</li>
                                <li>"Automatically Collected" Information:  When you use the Platform we may automatically record certain information about your use of the Platform that is made available through your web browser or mobile device such as your IP address, information about your hardware and software, links, images, or other materials you click, information that may enable us to approximate your location, and the date and time you access the Platform. In many cases this means that when you access the Platform, you are not anonymous to us.</li>
                                <li>"Cookies" Information: One form of "automatically collected" information we record is information stored by "cookies." When you use the Platform, we may send one or more cookies to your computer. We use both "session" and "persistent" cookies to collect, store, and sometimes track various types of information. A session cookie is one that disappears after you close your browser. While a persistent cookie remains after you close your browser (and may be used by your browser when you later return to the Platform), persistent cookies generally can be removed. You can review the appropriate "Help" file in your Web browser or your mobile device to learn the proper way to modify your cookie settings.</li>
                                <li>Integrated Service Information: You may be given the option to access or register for the Platform through the use of your user name and passwords for other services (each an "<strong>Integrated Service</strong>"), such as through the use of your Facebook credentials through Facebook Connect.  By doing this, you understand and authorize us to access and use all information that you and such Integrated Services permit us to use or access.  For Facebook, this means that upon sign up for the Platform, Facebook should ask your permission to share certain information from your Facebook account with the Platform.  Depending on the information you authorize us to access on Facebook, we may have access to a wide variety of information, such as your status updates, photos, videos, name, email address and information regarding your friends on Facebook. You should check your Facebook or other Integrated Service privacy settings to understand and change the information sent to us through Facebook Connect or other Integrated Services.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <div class="subtitle">Information Use</div>
                            <p>Echoed may use your information for several general purposes:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>to provide you with Platform information,</li>
                                <li>to support the Platform offered on the Site,</li>
                                <li>to contact you for feedback about the Platform,</li>

                                <li>to provide anonymous reporting for internal and external purposes,</li>

                                <li>to contact you for marketing and promotional purposes.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>You can opt-out of receiving certain communications to you, but we reserve the right to continue to send you certain communications relating to the Platform, such as service announcements and administrative messages, without offering you the opportunity to opt out of receiving them.</p><br/>
                            <p>Echoed will use information that you provide or that we collect from your use of the Platform to analyze and develop our marketing strategy, Site, Platform, and other technologies.</p><br/>
                            <p>Echoed will use information we receive from Integrated Services such as Facebook to enable you to connect with your friends or contacts on such Integrated Services when using the Platform.  For Facebook this means that you will be able to see all Content uploaded, posted, transmitted or otherwise provided to the Platform by your Facebook friends who are connected to the Platform through Facebook. Similarly, that means that we may provide features enabling your Facebook friends to find you and your Submissions.  We may also offer a feature enabling you to make your Submissions publicly viewable to anyone on the Internet.</p><br/>
                            <div class="subtitle">Information Sharing and Disclosure</div>
                            <p>Echoed does not rent, sell, or share personal information about you with other people or non-affiliated companies except: (a) to provide products or services that you've requested, or (b) if you choose to make such information available through a feature that makes your information available to others, or (c) when we have your permission, or (d) under any of the following circumstances:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>We provide certain information to service providers who work on behalf of, or with, the Company to help us provide the Platform and to communicate with you.</li>
                                <li>We provide certain information to Distributing Retailers that we work with in order to enable them to interface with the Platform, provide discounts or other benefits to you, and so Distributing Retailers can better understand how to optimize their offerings.</li>
                                <li>We provide certain information to keep you up to date on the latest product announcements, software updates, special offers, or other information we think you would like to hear about either from us or from our business partners (unless you have opted out of these types of communications).</li>
                                <li>We also may disclose information about you if we believe that doing so is legally required or is in our interest to protect our property or other legal rights (including, but not limited to, enforcement of our agreements), or the rights or property of others, or otherwise to help protect the safety or security of our Platform or of other persons, entities, facilities, or equipment. </li>
                                <li>We may disclose and otherwise transfer information about you to an acquirer, or to a successor or assignee, as part of any merger, acquisition, debt financing, sale of all or a portion of our assets, or similar transaction, as well as in the event of an insolvency, bankruptcy, or receivership, in which information about you is transferred to one or more third parties as one of our business assets.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <div class="subtitle">Choice</div>
                            <p>You may also decline to share certain information with Echoed, in which case Echoed may not be able to provide to you some of the features and functionality found on the Platform.  If Echoed offers a public profile feature, we will then provide features enabling you to update, correct, or delete some of your profile information and preferences.  Please note that while your changes are reflected promptly in active user databases, we may retain all information you submit for a variety of purposes, including backups and archiving, prevention of fraud and abuse, and analytics.  You may also modify the cookie settings on your Web browser or mobile device to limit the information you share.</p><br/>
                            <p>YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR MAINTAINING THE SECRECY OF YOUR UNIQUE PASSWORD AND ACCOUNT INFORMATION AT ALL TIMES.  Please be careful with this information.</p>
                            <div class="subtitle">Access</div>
                            <p>You may correct, amend, or delete your personally identifiable information by editing your profile (if we offer one) through the Platform or otherwise by emailing us at info@echoed.com.</p>
                            <div class="subtitle">Security</div>
                            <p>Echoed makes efforts to limit access to personal information about you to employees, contractors and service providers who we believe reasonably need to come into contact with that information to provide the Platform to you or as otherwise provided in this Privacy Policy.</p><br/>
                            <p>We have physical and technical safeguards designed to protect personal information we maintain about you.  However, notwithstanding these safeguards, unauthorized persons may access your personal information and account.  We cannot promise that your personal information will always be secure.</p>
                            <div class="subtitle">Third Party Sites</div>
                            <p>Some of the services included or accessible through the Platform are delivered or served by third-party companies that may place or recognize cookies, use web beacons (sometimes called "clear gifs") and other technology to track certain information about our Platform users. For example, the Platform may include certain integrations with third-party social networks. In the course of serving certain third-party social network functionality on the Platform, some third-party social network operators may place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser in order to collect certain information about your use of the Platform. In many cases, this information could be used to show you ads based on your interests on other Web sites. We do not have access to, nor control over, third-party companies' use of cookies or other tracking technologies or how they may be used.</p>
                            <div class="subtitle">Children</div>
                            <p>Echoed does not knowingly collect or retain personally identifiable information about persons under 13 years of age.  Any person who provides their personal information to Echoed through the Platform represents that they are 13 years of age or older.  If Echoed learns that personally identifiable information of persons under the age of 13 years has been collected on the Platform without verifiable parental consent, then Echoed will take the appropriate steps to delete this information.</p><br/>
                            <p>If you are a parent or guardian and discover that your child under the age of 13 has obtained a Platform account, then you may alert Echoed at info@echoed.com and request that Echoed delete that child's personal information from our systems.</p>
                            <div class="subtitle">International Users</div>
                            Users from outside the United States should be aware that they are submitting their information to servers within the United States and that they may not be entitled to the protections and remedies provided for under the laws of their places of residence.
                            <div class="subtitle">Your Consent to this Privacy Policy</div>
                            <p>By using the Platform, you agree to this Privacy Policy. Echoed may update this Privacy Policy from time to time on a going forward basis. We will notify you about significant changes in the way we treat personal information by sending a notice to the primary email address specified in your Echoed account and/or by placing a prominent notice on our site.
