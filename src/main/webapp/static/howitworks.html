                        After checkout, you will be given the opportunity to share your purchase with friends and receive a reward from the retailer in the form of a credit.  There are two ways to receive rewards:<br><br>
                        <div class="indent">
                            <ul type="square">
                                <li>Youll automatically earn a percentage off the item youve just purchased by showcasing the product within your Echoed Exhibit.</li>
                                <li>Youll also have the opportunity to receive a bigger reward by sharing the product with your friends</li>

                         The Echoed Exhibit is the place where you can check out everything you and your friends have purchased - its accessible via our Facebook app as well as Echoed.com.  (Click here to see the Exhibit in action)

                    <div class="hiw-text">
                        You’ll clearly be able to see the window of time and how many clicks from your friends it will take to receive a reward of at least 5% off the item that you’ve bought.<br><br>
                        Rewards aren’t for future purchases and your friends don’t have to buy the same item.  You receive a credit from the retailer based on the number of clicks registered for the same item you’ve already purchased.  No hoops to jump through, it’s 100% seamless.<br><br>
                        Better still, the more of your friends that click on your Echo, the greater reward you will receive - in some cases up to 30% off!<br><br>

                    Your Echoed purchase shows up as posts on Facebook and Tweets on Twitter.<br><br>
                    As soon as your friends click on the Echoes, the clicks are registered and count towards the total necessary to hit the minimum 5% off reward.<br><br>
                    You’ll be able to track the progress of your reward in real-time within the Echoed app on Facebook or Echoed.com.<br><br>
