                        Echoed amplifies the excitement and engagement of your existing customers across a broad network of their like-minded peers. The result is a recommendation from a friend that can be trusted...that&#39;s as real as it gets.</div>

                    <div class="secondary-text">As products are shared, they receive ample time in the spotlight, inciting conversation and exploration across a consumers entire social network. While this short-term exposure is extremely valuable, we&#39;ve thought about long-term brand impact as well.
                        <br/><br/>
                        Every Echoed purchase also lives in the consumers exhibit - think of it as a product gallery, where your products are the star of the show. Unlike other social activity, the exhibit lives forever.
                        Friends can browse each others exhibits and discover exciting products or their next favorite brand at any time.</div>
