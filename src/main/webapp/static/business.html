While this short-term exposure is extremely valuable, we&#39;ve thought about long-term brand impact as well.
                        <br/><br/>
                        Every Echoed purchase also lives in the consumers exhibit - think of it as a product gallery, where your products are the star of the show. Unlike other social activity, the exhibit lives forever.
                        Friends can browse each others exhibits and discover exciting products or their next favorite brand at any time.</div>
